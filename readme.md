# project3-team61

This is our web-based implementation of a boba tea shop POS system.

## Getting Started

The `.env` file with the database credentials is required to be placed in the backend directory.

To install dependencies and compile the frontend:
```
make build
```
This is the start step on the deployment server.

To run the server:
```
make run
```
This hosts on `8080` by default unless `PORT` environment variable is set.

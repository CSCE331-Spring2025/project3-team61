# project3-team61

This is our web implementation of a boba tea shop POS system.

## Getting Started

Currently, to run the project, you have to start both frontend and backend servers.

To install the npm packages you can run the following command from the root of the project
```
cd backend; npm install; cd ../frontend; npm install; cd ..
```

### Backend

To run the backend server, you will need the `.env` file with credentials to the database in your backend directory.
Contact Macsen for the `.env`.

To start the server, start a new terminal and run
```
cd backend; npm start
```
from the root.
This will run on 8080.

### Frontend

To run the frontend server, start a new terminal and run
```
cd frontend; npm run dev
```
from the root.

The frontend is typically hosted on [localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173); however,
    you should check the logged statement for the correct port.
